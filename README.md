1. How long did you spend on the coding assignment? What would you add to your
solution if you had more time? If you didn&#39;t spend much time on the coding test
then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your
chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you&#39;ve used
it.
3. What were the more challenging parts of this assignment for you?
4. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever
had to do this?
5. How would you improve the API that you just used?
6. Please describe yourself using JSON.


1. I spent approximately 2 hours on this assignment.
   In a perfect world I would have completed all the requirements, preferably adding the search bar first and so on. I have managed to fetch the data in the console.
   
2. React v16.9.0 has added act() to test asynchronus state updates 

3. I found converting the JSON object into array challenging 

4. To track down preformance issues, I would open up my inspector record the preformance and execute my functions 

5. Because I've only fetched the data at this point, I cannot think of a way to improve this API. However, I'm sure there is one!
