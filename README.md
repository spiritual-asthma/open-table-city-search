#Technical Questions 

1. I spent approximately 2 hours on this assignment.
   In a perfect world I would have completed all the requirements, preferably adding the search bar first and so on. I have managed to fetch the data in the console.
   
2. React v16.9.0 has added act() to test asynchronous state updates 

3. I found converting the JSON object into array challenging 

4. To track down preformance issues, I would open up my inspector record the preformance and execute my functions 

5. Because I've only fetched the data at this point, I cannot think of a way to improve this API. However, I'm sure there is one!
